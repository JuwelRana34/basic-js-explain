var givenNumber = 119
var reminder = givenNumber % 5
// console.log(reminder);


// task 4 
var a = isNaN('11');

// var a = isNaN(2-10);
console.log(a);


// this case in task 4 it will be if the isNaN function work fast it conver the argument into number than it will check  that's why we see our inputed value conver 11 and -8 its a number as a result  we will see the output is false
